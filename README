# Overview

This is a small and clean approach of providing the Ceph overall cluster health status via a restful json api as well as via a (hopefully) fancy web gui. There are no dependecies to the existing ceph-rest-api. This wsgi application talks to the cluster directly via librados.

# Usage

Step by step instructions on using the charm:

    juju deploy ceph-dash

You can then browse to http://ip-address to configure the service.

This charm has a dependency on graphite, nginx and uwsgi.

# Configuration

The configuration options will be listed on the charm store, however If you're making assumptions or opinionated decisions in the charm (like setting a default administrator password), you should detail that here so the user knows how to change it immediately, etc.

# Contact Information

Though this will be listed in the charm store itself don't assume a user will know that, so include that information here:


- Upstream website
- Upstream bug tracker
- Upstream mailing list or contact information
- Feel free to add things if it's useful for users
