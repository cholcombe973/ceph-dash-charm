# Overview

This is a small and clean approach of providing the Ceph overall cluster health status via a restful json api as well as via a (hopefully) fancy web gui. There are no dependecies to the existing ceph-rest-api. This wsgi application talks to the cluster directly via librados.

# Usage

Step by step instructions on using the charm:

    juju deploy ceph # The ceph dependency
    juju deploy ceph-dash
    juju add-relation ceph-dash ceph
    juju expose ceph-dash

You can then browse to http://ip-address to view the service.

This charm has a dependency on graphite, nginx and uwsgi.
